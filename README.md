# Horiseon Website - Refactoring & Accessibility

## Summary 

A refactor of the HTML/CSS for Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc, a marketing company, was requested; the objective was to increase the website's accessibility. I have learned alot from the experienced engineers and professors on this subject, but know I needed to learn more about what accessibility is as wehow is it measured or quantitifed to hopefully provide users an easier experience engaging with online content.

## Horiseon's User Story

"As a marketing agency, we want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own site is optimized for search engines."

## Acceptance Criteria
Accessibility standards will be met when:
    * Semantic HTML elements will be incorporated into the source code
    * The structure of the HTML elements flow logically, independent of style or position of elements
    * All image elements have a corresponding alt property
    * Heading attributes fall in sequential order
    * The title element is concise and descriptive
